# `👩‍💻 I'm Frontend Developer`

Programmer with experience in web development using ReactJS and NextJs, mobile development using React Native, component library creation with Storybook and testing with Testing Library. I have also worked with technologies such as React Redux, Redux Toolkit, i18next, Mapbox, React-hook-forms, Webview and Material-UI.

Currently, I am working as a Frontend Developer at Aconcagua Software Spain, where I have had the opportunity to further develop my skills with technologies like React.js, React Native and Next.js.

Additionally, I have had the chance to share my knowledge by conducting a workshop on Storybook with ReactJS.

I am passionate about continuing to grow professionally and taking on new challenges, always focused on excellence and committed to teamwork.

I have published some articles that you can read at [Huasi](www.huasi.dev).
