## Hi there üëã

# `üë©‚Äçüíª I'm Frontend Developer`

I am currently working at Aconcagua Software Spain, as a `Frontend Developer with ReactJs and React Native`. You can see more on my Linkedin profile:

I like to learn, I am self-taught. The solutions that are posted for different problems or questions about how to solve something help me a lot, so I leave some answers on Stackoverflow ([you can find my Stackoverflow profile here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/19827435/lucia-aldana)) and I also create some Gists with some processes hoping to give back some of that help.

## `üåü Gists`

### I have created some gists, [_you can see them all here:_](https://gist.github.com/luciaaldana)

- [X] Store: React-redux y Toolkit, 

- [X] Private and public routes (React router dom v6),

- [X] Absolute path in Vite project React TS (alias), 

- [X] i18next (react),

- [X] Mapbox GL JS WithReact,

- [X] some styles

‚ú® I hope it helps you.

## `ü§ñ My most used commands`

| Command | SHORCUTS OH MY ZSH | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `git add .` | `ga .` | we move the modified files from our working directory to the ready state.|
|`git commit -a -m 'description...'` | `gcam 'description...' `| We save the changes you have in the staging area. |
|`git push` | `gp`| We push changes from a local repository to a remote repository.|
|`git pull` | `gl`| We download content from a remote repository by updating the local repository |
|`git checkout name-branch` | `gco name-branch`| We move to the branch 'name-branch' that is already created |
|`git checkout -b name-new-branch` | `gco -b name-new-branch`| We move to the 'name-branch' branch that we are creating |

(üëΩ) It's always handy to have on hand:  `rm -rf ./node_modules && rm -f package-lock.json && npm i`
