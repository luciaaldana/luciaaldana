## Hi there 👋

# `👩‍💻 I'm Frontend Developer`

I am a self-taught programmer constantly learning and with experience in web development using ReactJS and mobile development with React Native, creating component libraries with Storybook and testing with Testing Library. I have also worked with technologies such as React Redux, Redux Toolkit, i18next, Mapbox, React-hook-forms, and Material-UI.

Currently, I work as a Frontend Developer at Aconcagua Software Spain, where I have had the opportunity to continue developing my skills with technologies such as React.js, React Native, React-hook-forms, Redux, i18n, Material-UI, Redux, Swagger API, postman, and Mapbox.

Additionally, I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge by teaching a workshop on Storybook with ReactJS.

I am passionate about continuing to grow professionally and facing new challenges, always focused on excellence and committed to teamwork.
