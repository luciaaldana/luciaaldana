## Hi there 👋

# `👩‍💻 I'm Frontend Developer`

I am currently working at Aconcagua Software Spain, as a `Frontend Developer with ReactJs and React Native`. You can see more on my Linkedin profile:

I like to learn, I am self-taught. The solutions that are posted for different problems or questions about how to solve something help me a lot, so I leave some answers on Stackoverflow ([you can find my Stackoverflow profile here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/19827435/lucia-aldana)) and I also create some Gists with some processes hoping to give back some of that help.

## `🌟 Gists`

## `🔥 Shortcut`
