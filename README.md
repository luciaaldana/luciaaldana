## Hi there 👋

# `👩‍💻 I'm Frontend Developer`

I am currently working at Aconcagua Software Spain, as a `Frontend Developer with ReactJs and React Native`. You can see more on my Linkedin profile:

I like to learn, I am self-taught. The solutions that are posted for different problems or questions about how to solve something help me a lot, so I leave some answers on Stackoverflow ([you can find my Stackoverflow profile here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/19827435/lucia-aldana)) and I also create some Gists with some processes hoping to give back some of that help.

## `🌟 Gists`

### I have created some gists, [_you can see them all here:_](https://gist.github.com/luciaaldana)

- [X] Store: React-redux y Toolkit, 

- [X] Private and public routes (React router dom v6),

- [X] Absolute path in Vite project React TS (alias), 

- [X] i18next (react),

- [X] Mapbox GL JS WithReact,

- [X] some styles

✨ I hope it helps you.
